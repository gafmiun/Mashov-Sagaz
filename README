flow and key functions:

1) Load & Validate Data

excel_to_dataframe() – loads the Excel file into a DataFrame.

validate_excel() – checks that all expected columns exist and removes irrelevan


2) Calculate Statistics
Per-Commander:

calculations_on_seperated_data() – core function computing all commander-specific stats.

count_occurrences() – counts how many respondents selected each option.

compute_percent() – converts counts to percentages.

compute_commander_general_stats() – computes average & std of the general rating.

Cohort-Level:

calculate_total_percentage() – computes cohort-wide percentages for each option.

add_general_question_mahzor() – adds overall cohort average for the general question.


3) Build Context for Word Report
build_basic_info_context() – commander name + number of respondents.

build_bullet_lists_context() – extracts and cleans all open-text comments.

merge_bullet_lists() – merges all context needed for templating.


4) Generate Word Report

replace_placeholders() – fills the Word template with commander statistics.

add_bullet_lists() – renders structured bullet lists inside the Word file.


5) Generate Excel Outputs
Sheet 1 – Quantitative:

build_quantitative_header_block() – header with commander info and general ratings.

build_quantitative_table_header() – dynamic option headers.

build_quantitative_question_row() – builds each question’s option rows.

Sheet 2 – Textual:

collect_text_answers() – collects written feedback per question.

build_textual_sheet() – organizes text answers into equal-length columns.
