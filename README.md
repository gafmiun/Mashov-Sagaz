# Mashov-Sagaz

this is the MASHOV SAGAZ project

the code fits the template created in october 2025.

the general flow of the code is:

1) data collection from the excel of replies to the google forms. note that the code assumes that all the questions are mandatory.

2) data preprocessing (taking only the relevant), cleaning (removing invalid entries), and transforming (encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical variables).

3) filling the word template with the processed data.

THINGS TO DO:
1) currently, the code for the filling of the verbal points is done using a different package than the rest of the
Document generation. this causes the doc generation to work for either the table or the verbal points, but not both at
 the same time.

2) deal with the last table, which is currently not handled at all!!

3) make sure that the points and bullets are all filled, and not just the first one i checked.

4) generally, make sure it all works. TEST!
